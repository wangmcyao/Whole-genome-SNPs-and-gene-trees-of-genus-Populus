# Whole-genome-SNPs-and-gene-trees-of-genus-Populus
A final set of 12.93 million biallelic SNPs based on whole-genome sequencing data of 80 individuals from 29 Populus species, and individual gene trees of all single copy genes

We divided the whole genome biallelic SNPs into 10 Mbp windows:

ChrXX_YY.vcf.gz: ChrXX means the chromosome number of Populus trichocarpa gnome, YY means the window number

Scaffold.vcf.gz: SNPs located on all scaffolds

In all vcf files, 'AC' refers to Allele count, 'GT' referes to genotype and 'DP' refers to depth

c12.genetree: Gene trees based on the first and second codon positions of 5305 single copy genes in genus Populus

c3.genetree: Gene trees based on the third codon positions of 5305 single copy genes in genus Populus

cds.genetree: Gene trees based on the complete coding sequences of 5305 single copy genes in genus Populus
